AMI\u2019s insurance benefits and 401k Plan are factors that are helping him positively look to the future. \u201cI look forward to early, cool mornings fishing on the lake\u201d, he says. \u201cRight now, most free time is spent painting, drywalling, and working on my house, but I look forward to more time with a fishing pole in my hands.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Andrew\u2019s career has been diverse. \u201cI worked in construction since High School and spent some time in a factory and a slaughterhouse. During shutdowns in the factory, I worked with my cousin doing finish carpentry, and then got into Residential Construction.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Most people at AMI are probably not aware that Andrew earned a Bachelor Degree in Biology Natural Resources from Central Michigan University. \u201cI am proud of the degree, but decided that two more years earning a Masters Degree wasn\u2019t what I wanted,\u201d says Andrew. \u201cI was making a great living in construction and decided to make that my career.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Andrew was one of the most recent graduates of the Journeyman Program at AMI. He has an appreciation for the opportunities this will provide and felt that his instructors at AMI were very helpful.<\/p>\n<p>His first opportunity to lead a job, as Foreman, was at the recently completed Bradford White R &amp; D building in Middleville. \u201cI had worked with all of the guys and the General Contractor before,\u201d he said, \u201cand everyone understood it was my first chance at leading a crew. Everyone was very supportive.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Andrew says he hopes to continue as a Foreman with AMI for a number of years and hopes to mentor new Field Workers. Perhaps later, he plans to look at moving up in the company, perhaps as a Project Manager.<\/p>\n<p>We appreciate everything you do to personify the AMI Mission, Andrew!
