										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Portland, MI. — The U.S. Army, Architectural Metals, Inc., and Vos Glass have signed a partnership agreement on April 26. 2022, as part of the U.S. Army Partnership for Youth Success (PaYS) program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The PaYS Program is a strategic partnership between the Army and a cross section of pri-vate industry, academia and state and local public institutes. The U.S. Army PaYS Pro-gram guarantees Soldiers five job interviews and possible employment after their service in the Army. The PaYS Program provides America’s youth with the unique opportunity to simultaneously serve their country and prepare for their future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The PaYS program is designed to help Soldiers prepare for a career after the Army by connecting them with employers who understand the skills, discipline and work ethic that military service members bring to a business. This program is part of a long-term U.S. Army effort to help Soldiers forge professional relationships with businesses and encour-age business owners to look to the Army as a plentiful and reliable recruiting source. Since PaYS began in 2000, more than 1095 employers have partnered with the program.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Andrew Roberts joined the AMI Family in March of 2017, after a time working in Residential Construction.</p>
<p>The seasonal fluctuations of working on homes pushed his desire for a career in Commercial Construction, and the steadiness of year-long employment has been one of the many things he has appreciated at AMI. AMI’s insurance benefits and 401k Plan are factors that are helping him positively look to the future. “I look forward to early, cool mornings fishing on the lake”, he says. “Right now, most free time is spent painting, drywalling, and working on my house, but I look forward to more time with a fishing pole in my hands.”</p>
<p>Andrew’s career has been diverse. “I worked in construction since High School and spent some time in a factory and a slaughterhouse. During shutdowns in the factory, I worked with my cousin doing finish carpentry, and then got into Residential Construction.”</p>
<p>Most people at AMI are probably not aware that Andrew earned a Bachelor Degree in Biology Natural Resources from Central Michigan University. “I am proud of the degree, but decided that two more years earning a Masters Degree wasn’t what I wanted,” says Andrew. “I was making a great living in construction and decided to make that my career.”</p>
<p>Andrew was one of the most recent graduates of the Journeyman Program at AMI. He has an appreciation for the opportunities this will provide and felt that his instructors at AMI were very helpful.</p>
<p>His first opportunity to lead a job, as Foreman, was at the recently completed Bradford White R &amp; D building in Middleville. “I had worked with all of the guys and the General Contractor before,” he said, “and everyone understood it was my first chance at leading a crew. Everyone was very supportive.”</p>
<p>Andrew says he hopes to continue as a Foreman with AMI for a number of years and hopes to mentor new Field Workers. Perhaps later, he plans to look at moving up in the company, perhaps as a Project Manager.</p>
<p>We appreciate everything you do to personify the AMI Mission, Andrew! URAMI!</p>
